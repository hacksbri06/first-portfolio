    <p> I am also an active member of the Innovation Club, which started meeting in-person again
        in 2021. We slowly became active as we plan new acitivies every Friday afternoon that enhance
        our learning. This year we plan to visit a VR acitivity room in Austin!

        Recently, we made a visit to Dell in Austin, TX. Jonathan Campbell, a DMI Texas State Alumni
        gave us a tour and explained to us how he became a Software Engineer as a recent grauduate.
